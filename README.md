# CPP_Assignment_3

How to run:

This program has a working makefile.
To compile type "make"
To run type "./findcomp [parameters]

The order of the parameters does not matter and both -p and -w are optional.



If you wish to run the unit tests type "run test".
This will automatically run the unit test program.
Note: one of the tests print out data instead of a REQUIRE statement

A "make clean" command is also available.

Note:When running with the -p parameter to print to an output file the code is very inefficient, give it about 10 seconds to produce the output file.
